It is a Customer Facing application where the user can directly access the application to get the quote for the products. This application can also be accessed by dealers to get the quotes for bulk products. This application is designed to handle the operations performed by the customer service. A user can contact the customer service or go the web page to get the quote for the products. The advantage of the using the website to get the quote is that customer can upload their custom logo on the products. All the information that is taken from the customer is validated by the customer service agents and will provide sample images to the customer which has the custom logo product. The customer can make changes or approve the products. If the customer approves the custom product it will proceed to the credit card department for further processing. Once the credit card payment is done customer will be directed to the order status page which has all the tracking details about the ordered products. The customer can see the tracking details by clicking on the tracking number provided in the order status page. Each product will have a status whether the product is shipped or delivered. The dealer will have the same view as the customer except the dealer has to provide some additional details about their organization and the purpose of the purchase. This application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery and salesforce lighting components.
